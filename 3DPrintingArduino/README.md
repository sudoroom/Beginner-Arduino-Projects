# 3D Printed Cases for the Arduino

SudoRoom.org has a 3D Printer, which is handy for making customized cases for your Arduino!

# Future Projects

We want to hack these Arduino Bumper and case projects to make SudoRoom Arduino cases. 

Printing cases and selling them to workshop attendees for a humble fee would be a great way to help SudoRoom pay rent too!

See this Raspberry pi here? Wouldn't it be great to have a SudoRoom Arduino bumper?
